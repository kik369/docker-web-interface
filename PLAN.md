# Docker Web Interface - Project Plan

## ⚠️ CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES ⚠️

1. **NEVER RESTART ANY SERVICES**

    - **DO NOT** restart the frontend server
    - **DO NOT** restart the backend server
    - **DO NOT** restart Docker containers
    - **DO NOT** restart the Docker Compose stack
    - The system has hot-reload enabled in all components
    - Code changes will automatically be applied without any restarts

2. **IMPLEMENTATION CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**
    - **ALWAYS** ask the user to confirm if a feature has been successfully implemented
    - **NEVER** mark tasks as completed without explicit user confirmation
    - Only move items to "Recently Completed Work" after user verification
    - If the user indicates the implementation is not complete, keep the task in the To-Do list

## Overview

This document serves as the central coordination point for the Docker Web Interface project. It provides:

1. A registry of all documentation files
2. Guidelines for maintaining documentation
3. Current project status and to-do items
4. Recently completed work

This document should be consulted before making any changes to the codebase and updated after changes have been completed.

## Documentation Guidelines

### Before Making Changes

1. **Always consult relevant documentation first**

    - Check architecture diagrams to understand components
    - Review API contracts before changing endpoints
    - Understand WebSocket events before modifying real-time features

2. **Cross-reference related documentation**

    - Changes may affect multiple documentation files
    - Ensure you understand all affected components

3. **Review current to-do list**
    - Check if your changes align with planned work
    - Identify potential conflicts with ongoing work

### After Making Changes

1. **Update all affected documentation immediately**

    - Keep diagrams synchronized with code
    - Update API documentation when endpoints change
    - Revise workflow documentation when features change

2. **Update this plan document**

    - Move completed items to "Recently Completed Work"
    - Add new to-do items as they are identified
    - Update project status section

3. **Add a changelog entry**
    - Document significant changes
    - Note any breaking changes that affect other components

## Current Project Status

### Active Development Areas

Currently, all planned features have been implemented. The project is in a stable state with no active development tasks.

### To-Do Items

-   [ ] Navigation Bar Structure and Spacing
    -   Simplify the DOM structure of the navigation bar
    -   Add a semantic nav element to improve accessibility
    -   Standardize padding with consistent values (py-3)
    -   Add a subtle border to visually separate the navigation from content
    -   Ensure consistent spacing between navigation and main content
    -   Limit the border width to match the content container width

## Recently Completed Work

### Layout Spacing Improvements (Completed 2023-08-18)

-   [x] Reduced spacing below the navigation bar for a more compact layout
-   [x] Removed the horizontal line separator for a cleaner interface
-   [x] Adjusted padding and margins throughout the application for consistent spacing
-   [x] Improved container and image card spacing for better visual balance
-   [x] Maintained subtle visual separation while reducing excessive whitespace

**Implementation Summary:**

The application layout has been updated to reduce excessive spacing and create a more balanced visual appearance. The changes include:

**UI Improvements:**

-   Reduced vertical padding in the header section from `py-4` to `py-2`
-   Removed the horizontal line separator between the header and content
-   Added a small bottom margin to the header (`mb-2`) to maintain proper spacing
-   Adjusted main content padding from `py-6` to `py-2` for a more compact layout
-   Reduced container padding from `p-4` to `p-3` for better space utilization
-   Decreased spacing between container elements for improved visual density
-   Updated container margins for consistent spacing throughout the application

These changes enhance the user experience by providing a more efficient use of screen space while maintaining clear visual separation between elements. The layout now feels more balanced and cohesive, with appropriate spacing that doesn't feel excessive.

### UI Consistency Between Containers and Images Tabs (Completed 2023-08-17)

-   [x] Added consistent container styling to the Images tab to match the Containers tab
-   [x] Wrapped image list in a container with the same visual styling as container groups
-   [x] Improved visual hierarchy with header section and content section
-   [x] Maintained consistent shadow and border styling across both tabs

**Implementation Summary:**

The Images tab has been updated to match the visual styling of the Containers tab for better UI consistency. The changes include:

**UI Improvements:**

-   Added a container wrapper around the images list with the same styling as container groups
-   Created a header section with the "Docker Images" title and count badge
-   Applied consistent shadow and border styling to match the Containers tab
-   Maintained the same visual hierarchy between both tabs

These changes enhance the user experience by providing a more consistent visual design across the application. The Images tab now has the same container-based layout as the Containers tab, improving the overall coherence of the interface.

### Container Shadow Consistency Improvements (Completed 2023-08-16)

-   [x] Standardized shadow appearance across light and dark modes
-   [x] Created a more prominent bottom shadow that gradually fades toward the top
-   [x] Applied consistent styling to all container and image elements
-   [x] Added subtle border with appropriate opacity for better definition
-   [x] Ensured visual consistency between container groups and individual items

**Implementation Summary:**

The container and image elements have been updated to provide a more consistent visual appearance between light and dark modes. The changes include:

**UI Improvements:**

-   Replaced the default shadow-lg with a custom shadow that's more prominent at the bottom
-   Added a subtle border with appropriate opacity to better define the container edges
-   Created a consistent shadow effect that works well in both light and dark modes
-   Applied the same shadow styling to container groups, container rows, and image rows
-   Ensured the shadow appearance is balanced and not too heavy in either mode

These changes enhance the user experience by providing a more cohesive and polished visual design. The containers now have a consistent appearance across the application, with shadows that provide appropriate depth without being too prominent or distracting.

## Implementation Workflow

### Standard Implementation Process

1. **Planning Phase**

    - Consult PLAN.md and relevant documentation
    - Understand the feature requirements and constraints
    - Plan the implementation approach

2. **Implementation Phase**

    - Make necessary code changes
    - Follow all coding standards and conventions
    - **NEVER restart any services** - all changes should apply with hot-reload

3. **Documentation Phase**

    - Update relevant documentation files
    - Document any deviations from the original plan
    - Prepare implementation summary for user confirmation

4. **Confirmation Phase**

    - Present implementation summary to the user
    - Ask explicitly: "Has this feature been successfully implemented?"
    - Only mark as complete after receiving affirmative confirmation
    - Template for confirmation request:

    ```
    Implementation Summary:
    - [List key changes made]
    - [Describe how the feature works now]
    - [Note any limitations or future improvements]

    Has this feature been successfully implemented and can it be moved to the "Recently Completed Work" section?
    ```
