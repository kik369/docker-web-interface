# Docker Web Interface - Project Plan

## Overview

This document serves as the central coordination point for the Docker Web Interface project. It provides:

1. A registry of all documentation files
2. Guidelines for maintaining documentation
3. Current project status and to-do items
4. Recently completed work

This document should be consulted before making any changes to the codebase and updated after changes have been completed.

## Documentation Guidelines

### Before Making Changes

1. **Always consult relevant documentation first**

    - Check architecture diagrams to understand components
    - Review API contracts before changing endpoints
    - Understand WebSocket events before modifying real-time features

2. **Cross-reference related documentation**

    - Changes may affect multiple documentation files
    - Ensure you understand all affected components

3. **Review current to-do list**
    - Check if your changes align with planned work
    - Identify potential conflicts with ongoing work

### After Making Changes

1. **Update all affected documentation immediately**

    - Keep diagrams synchronized with code
    - Update API documentation when endpoints change
    - Revise workflow documentation when features change

2. **Update this plan document**

    - Move completed items to "Recently Completed Work"
    - Add new to-do items as they are identified
    - Update project status section

3. **Add a changelog entry**
    - Document significant changes
    - Note any breaking changes that affect other components

## Current Project Status

### Active Development Areas

1. **Real-time Container Metrics**

    - Adding resource usage statistics to container view
    - Creating time-series visualizations of metrics

2. **Authentication System**

    - Designing JWT-based authentication
    - Integrating with WebSocket connections

3. **Documentation Enhancement**
    - Creating comprehensive API documentation
    - Updating diagrams to reflect current architecture

### To-Do Items

#### High Priority
