# Docker Web Interface - Project Plan

## ⚠️ CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES ⚠️

1. **NEVER RESTART ANY SERVICES**

    - **DO NOT** restart the frontend server
    - **DO NOT** restart the backend server
    - **DO NOT** restart Docker containers
    - **DO NOT** restart the Docker Compose stack
    - The system has hot-reload enabled in all components
    - Code changes will automatically be applied without any restarts

2. **IMPLEMENTATION CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**
    - **ALWAYS** ask the user to confirm if a feature has been successfully implemented
    - **NEVER** mark tasks as completed without explicit user confirmation
    - Only move items to "Recently Completed Work" after user verification
    - If the user indicates the implementation is not complete, keep the task in the To-Do list

## Overview

This document serves as the central coordination point for the Docker Web Interface project. It provides:

1. A registry of all documentation files
2. Guidelines for maintaining documentation
3. Current project status and to-do items
4. Recently completed work

This document should be consulted before making any changes to the codebase and updated after changes have been completed.

## Documentation Guidelines

### Before Making Changes

1. **Always consult relevant documentation first**

    - Check architecture diagrams to understand components
    - Review API contracts before changing endpoints
    - Understand WebSocket events before modifying real-time features

2. **Cross-reference related documentation**

    - Changes may affect multiple documentation files
    - Ensure you understand all affected components

3. **Review current to-do list**
    - Check if your changes align with planned work
    - Identify potential conflicts with ongoing work

### After Making Changes

1. **Update all affected documentation immediately**

    - Keep diagrams synchronized with code
    - Update API documentation when endpoints change
    - Revise workflow documentation when features change

2. **Update this plan document**

    - Move completed items to "Recently Completed Work"
    - Add new to-do items as they are identified
    - Update project status section

3. **Add a changelog entry**
    - Document significant changes
    - Note any breaking changes that affect other components

## Current Project Status

### Active Development Areas

Currently, all planned features have been implemented. The project is in a stable state with no active development tasks.

### To-Do Items

-   [ ] Navigation Bar Structure and Spacing
    -   Simplify the DOM structure of the navigation bar
    -   Add a semantic nav element to improve accessibility
    -   Standardize padding with consistent values (py-3)
    -   Add a subtle border to visually separate the navigation from content
    -   Ensure consistent spacing between navigation and main content
    -   Limit the border width to match the content container width
-   [ ] Container and Image Item Spacing Consistency
    -   Adjust the margin or padding of container items to match the spacing used for image items
    -   Ensure uniform vertical spacing between items and their respective containers
    -   Verify responsiveness across different screen sizes
-   [ ] Docker Container Status Display Overhaul
    -   Fix incorrect container status display after state transitions
    -   Ensure UI accurately reflects current container status without manual refresh
    -   Implement proper transition states (starting, stopping, restarting)
    -   Fix WebSocket event handling for container state changes

## Recently Completed Work

-   Implemented Command Palette Z-Index and Log Closing Fix (March 20, 2025)

    -   Fixed command palette to always appear on top of all elements, including full screen logs
    -   Ensured command palette has the highest z-index in the application (10000)
    -   Added automatic log closing when selecting containers or images from the command palette
    -   Improved user experience by ensuring command palette is always accessible with Ctrl+K
    -   Fixed issue where full screen logs would remain open when navigating via command palette

-   Implemented Full Screen Mode for Container Logs (March 19, 2025)
    -   Added a new "Full Screen" button next to existing Follow, Live Indicator, and Close buttons
    -   Implemented fullscreen mode that expands log text to occupy the entire browser window
    -   Used React Portal to ensure proper rendering above all other UI elements
    -   Added keyboard shortcut (Escape key) to exit fullscreen mode
    -   Ensured scrolling functionality works properly in fullscreen mode
    -   Added visual indicators and styling to improve user experience
    -   Fixed overlap issues with navigation bar for a clean, uninterrupted view
-   Implemented Command Palette Selection Glow Effect (March 18, 2025)
    -   Added subtle glow animation to enhance visibility of selected items from the command palette
    -   Created theme-aware glow effects with different colors for light/dark modes
    -   Synchronized the glow effect with the existing scale animation
    -   Ensured consistent behavior across container and image components
-   Implemented icon consistency across the application (March 17, 2025)
    -   Updated Docker Compose stack application description to use the container icon (HiOutlineCube) instead of the image icon
    -   Updated command palette to use the same icons as the navigation bar for containers and images
    -   Standardized log-related icons across the application using HiOutlineDocumentText
    -   Ensured consistent styling and colors for all icons
-   Fixed tooltip positioning inconsistency in the images tab (March 16, 2025)
    -   Standardized tooltip component nesting pattern across the application
    -   Ensured tooltips always appear directly above their associated elements
    -   Fixed inconsistent positioning of tooltips for Size and Created Time fields

All other recent work has been completed and documented. The project is in a stable state with the copy functionality working as expected.

## Implementation Workflow

### Standard Implementation Process

1. **Planning Phase**

    - Consult PLAN.md and relevant documentation
    - Understand the feature requirements and constraints
    - Plan the implementation approach

2. **Implementation Phase**

    - Make necessary code changes
    - Follow all coding standards and conventions
    - **NEVER restart any services** - all changes should apply with hot-reload

3. **Documentation Phase**

    - Update relevant documentation files
    - Document any deviations from the original plan
    - Prepare implementation summary for user confirmation

4. **Confirmation Phase**

    - Present implementation summary to the user
    - Ask explicitly: "Has this feature been successfully implemented?"
    - Only mark as complete after receiving affirmative confirmation
    - Template for confirmation request:

    ```
    Implementation Summary:
    - [List key changes made]
    - [Describe how the feature works now]
    - [Note any limitations or future improvements]

    Has this feature been successfully implemented and can it be moved to the "Recently Completed Work" section?
    ```
