# Docker Web Interface - Project Plan

## ⚠️ CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES ⚠️

1. **NEVER RESTART ANY SERVICES**

    - **DO NOT** restart the frontend server
    - **DO NOT** restart the backend server
    - **DO NOT** restart Docker containers
    - **DO NOT** restart the Docker Compose stack
    - The system has hot-reload enabled in all components
    - Code changes will automatically be applied without any restarts

2. **IMPLEMENTATION CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**
    - **ALWAYS** ask the user to confirm if a feature has been successfully implemented
    - **NEVER** mark tasks as completed without explicit user confirmation
    - Only move items to "Recently Completed Work" after user verification
    - If the user indicates the implementation is not complete, keep the task in the To-Do list

## Overview

This document serves as the central coordination point for the Docker Web Interface project. It provides:

1. A registry of all documentation files
2. Guidelines for maintaining documentation
3. Current project status and to-do items
4. Recently completed work

This document should be consulted before making any changes to the codebase and updated after changes have been completed.

## Documentation Guidelines

### Before Making Changes

1. **Always consult relevant documentation first**

    - Check architecture diagrams to understand components
    - Review API contracts before changing endpoints
    - Understand WebSocket events before modifying real-time features

2. **Cross-reference related documentation**

    - Changes may affect multiple documentation files
    - Ensure you understand all affected components

3. **Review current to-do list**
    - Check if your changes align with planned work
    - Identify potential conflicts with ongoing work

### After Making Changes

1. **Update all affected documentation immediately**

    - Keep diagrams synchronized with code
    - Update API documentation when endpoints change
    - Revise workflow documentation when features change

2. **Update this plan document**

    - Move completed items to "Recently Completed Work"
    - Add new to-do items as they are identified
    - Update project status section

3. **Add a changelog entry**
    - Document significant changes
    - Note any breaking changes that affect other components

## Current Project Status

### Active Development Areas

Currently, all planned features have been implemented. The project is in a stable state with no active development tasks.

### To-Do Items

No pending tasks at this time. All planned features have been successfully implemented.

## Recently Completed Work

-   Docker Container Status Display Overhaul (March 16, 2025)

    -   Fixed incorrect container status display after state transitions
    -   Ensured UI accurately reflects current container status without manual refresh
    -   Implemented proper transition states (starting, stopping, restarting)
    -   Fixed WebSocket event handling for container state changes
    -   Added verification of container state against actual Docker state
    -   Improved UI feedback during state transitions
    -   Fixed event name inconsistency between backend and frontend

-   Log Streaming Performance Optimization (March 16, 2025)

    -   Increased WebSocket buffer delay from 100ms to 200ms to reduce React re-renders
    -   Implemented optimized log rendering with line capping to handle large log volumes
    -   Added priority-based streaming based on container visibility
    -   Implemented pause/resume functionality for log streams
    -   Optimized log size management to prevent memory issues
    -   Improved overall UI responsiveness when multiple log streams are active

## Implementation Workflow

### Standard Implementation Process

1. **Planning Phase**

    - Consult PLAN.md and relevant documentation
    - Understand the feature requirements and constraints
    - Plan the implementation approach

2. **Implementation Phase**

    - Make necessary code changes
    - Follow all coding standards and conventions
    - **NEVER restart any services** - all changes should apply with hot-reload

3. **Documentation Phase**

    - Update relevant documentation files
    - Document any deviations from the original plan
    - Prepare implementation summary for user confirmation

4. **Confirmation Phase**

    - Present implementation summary to the user
    - Ask explicitly: "Has this feature been successfully implemented?"
    - Only mark as complete after receiving affirmative confirmation
    - Template for confirmation request:

    ```
    Implementation Summary:
    - [List key changes made]
    - [Describe how the feature works now]
    - [Note any limitations or future improvements]

    Has this feature been successfully implemented and can it be moved to the "Recently Completed Work" section?
    ```
